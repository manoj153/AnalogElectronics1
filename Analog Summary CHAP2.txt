<->Filters basicaly eliminates fluctuations in rectified voltage.
<-->Regulators, Maintains a constant voltage.

<Half-Wave-Rectifier>

<*>Only postivie cycle produces a DC output, Procduce same shape as Vin.
<->Output will lost negative cycle and and postive cycle is (Vin - 0.7v), Negative cycle DC output = 0.
<-->Simply because of Diode charestics that only FB at positive cycle and some voltage drop across.
<*>PIV = Vin.

</Half-Wave-Rectifier>

<Full-Wave-Rectifier>

<*>Vout = (Vin/2)-0.7v
<*>Both +pCycle and -nCycle of Sinosudiol AC input is rectified to DC output.
<*> Related Formula
<-> (n = n1/n2) # 
<--> (n*Vin = Vout)

</Full-Wave-Rectifier>

<Full-Wave-Bridge-Rectifier>

<*> Vout = Vin - 1.4v
<-> Because of two diode in FB drop.
<*> PIV = Vin - 0.7v

<Diode-Limiter>
<*> Negative Voltage Limiter.
<-> Series R1 from source parallel with Diode (RB in +veCycle).
<*> During -veCycle, I only flows through D1
<-> Forward Bias and least resistance path 
<-->Thus Vout = 0.7v
<*> Postive Voltage Limiter Opposite of above.
