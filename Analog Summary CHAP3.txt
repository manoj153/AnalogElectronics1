<ZenerDiode>
<.>Works(conducts) on FB and RB(breakdown)Z.
<.>Fb = 0.7v
<.>Zb = ~~
<.>Zener Impidance, Z = ∆V/∆I..
<->After knee current is the range, (IZk, IZt, Izm)
<*>Application : Voltage Regulator, Fixed Refrence Voltage.
<->Once the Z.d enters the Zener effect,vary in current result in very small change in voltage, thus it acts like a V.Reg.
</ZenerDiode>

<Varactor>

<*>Basically, it's a variable capacitor. 
<*>As Rb++, C--.. 
<->Because widening of depletion region increases the distance apart the both ends(Plates). 
<-->Above stament is proved by C= ke A /d.

<LED>

<*>Recombination of holes with e_ causes large amount of energy released in the form of photon.
<*>Process of emitting light is called ELECTROLUMINESCENCE.
<*>Doping with impurities determines the wavelength of emitted light.
<*>Vb 1.5v-3.2v.
<*>Application : 7-segment display, LED torch light.

</LED>

<PhotoDiode>

<*>Works on Reverse Bias condition as well.
